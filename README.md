Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Execute the following commands:

`!pip install liwc
!pip install vaderSentiment
 !pip install nltk`

The ensuing steps should be in the code cells inside the files.

Ensure that the two data files are in the same directory as the code files, or change the correct file path in the dataframe definitions.

The code should be runnable in any Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.

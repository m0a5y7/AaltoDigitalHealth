# Understanding depression and anxiety through social media

In this final project for the Digital Health and Human Behaviour course, social media posts about depression and anxiety were analysed. After preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, it was found that there is some overlap between both themes and specific posting habits such as posting late at night, or correlated sentiments such as sadness or anger. LIWC and Vader were used for linguistic and sentiment analysis. Tf-idf scores were also calculated to highlight frequent words present in both datasets.

# Installation

Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Execute the following commands:

`!pip install liwc
!pip install vaderSentiment
!pip install nltk`

The ensuing steps should be in the code cells inside the files.

Ensure that the two data files are in the same directory as the code files, or change the correct file path in the dataframe definitions.

The code should be runnable in any Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
